    <h1> HTML</h1>
    <P>(HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure 
        a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured 
        within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
         and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a 
         basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</P>
        
         

<H2>CSS</H2>
<P> ascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. 
    These pages contain information on how to learn and use CSS and on available software. 
    They also contain news from the CSS working group</P>
    
    <H3> JAVA SCRIPT</H3>
    <P> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
        web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
        for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
        scrolling video jukeboxes,</P>
